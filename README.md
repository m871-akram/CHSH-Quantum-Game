# CHSH-Quantum-Game
A Qiskit-based simulation of the CHSH quantum game, demonstrating quantum entanglement and the violation of Bell's inequalities. The project creates entangled Bell states, applies measurement settings, and calculates the success probability, achieving a quantum advantage over the classical limit of 0.75.
